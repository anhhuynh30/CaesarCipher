Caesar Cipher:

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. It's simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed nuber of positions down the alphabet.

For example: if we have an offset/shift of 1, then A would be replace by B, B would be replaced by C, and so on. Similarly, if we have an offset of 4, then the text "ATTACKATONCE" would become "EXXEGOEXSRGI".
